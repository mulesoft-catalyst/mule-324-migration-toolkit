      component: "The Mule 3 application contains <x> components out of which <y> were successfully migrated by MMA."
      expression: "Also, the MMA was able to convert <x> MEL expressions and <y> DW 1.0 expressions into DW 2.0."
      standard: "The score is derived from an estimated manual effort required to migrate any remaining MEL/ DW expressions and the following Standard/ OOTB Mule components (and their number of occurrences in the application) which the MMA either failed to migrate or migrated them with warnings: <x>."
      custom: "A default score was applied to calculate the manual effort for <x> custom components (and their number of occurrences in the application) as the migration of these is not supported by MMA: <y>."
